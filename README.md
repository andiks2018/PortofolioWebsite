# PortofolioWebsite
My personal portofolio website made with vanilla Javascript, CSS, GSAP and Sal.js for animations and JQuerry for some scrolling animations.

The website is also mobile-friendly, being fully responsive, made with the help of Bootstrap flex display components and media querries.

The website is live at andreiplesuweb.com
